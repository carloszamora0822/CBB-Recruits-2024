⭐️ This project focuses on creating a C++ class called "Recruit" to manage information about the top 100 college basketball recruits. 
⭐️ The class includes constructors, destructors, and get/set methods for attributes such as name, position, city, school, and player stats (e.g., height, weight, stars, grade).
⭐️ Additionally, the project implements file I/O methods for reading and displaying recruit data.
